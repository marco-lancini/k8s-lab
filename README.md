# K8S-LAB

Modular Kubernetes Lab which provides an easy and streamlined way (managed via [please.build](https://please.build/)) to deploy a test cluster with support for different components.

Each component can be deployed in a repeatable way with one single command.

Usage for supported components:

1. [Vault](docs/vault.md)
2. [ELK](docs/elk.md)
3. ...


## Prerequisites

* Plz (see [official docs](https://please.build/quickstart.html) for your OS)
