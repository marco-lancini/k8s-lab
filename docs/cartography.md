# Cartography Setup

[Cartography](https://github.com/lyft/cartography) is a Python tool that consolidates infrastructure assets and the relationships between them in an intuitive graph view powered by a Neo4j database.

| Vault                      | ‚ö†Ô∏è This module depends on a Vault installation. Please refer to [Vault Setup](vault.md) for more information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Cloud Provider Credentials | You will need to generate access tokens for Cartography to use.<br>For example, for AWS you can use the [aws-security-reviewer](https://github.com/marco-lancini/utils/tree/main/terraform/aws-security-reviewer) Terraform module to automate the setup of roles and users needed to perform a security audit of AWS accounts in an Hub and Spoke model. After this, generate access keys for the IAM user and keep them ready to use |



## Deploy Cartography and Neo4j
```bash
‚ùØ plz run //components/cartography:deploy [minikube|baremetal]
```
* Setup namespace: creates a `cartography` namespace, and a Vault Agent service account
* Setup and Deploy Neo4j:
  * Generates a random password for Neo4j and stores it into Vault
  * Generates TLS Certificates and Ingress (baremetal only)
  * Created a StorageClass and PersistentVolume (baremetal only)
  * Deploys the Neo4j StatefulSet and Service
* Setup and Deploy Cartography:
  * Creates a custom Docker image for Cartography
  * Requests user to provide access key, secret key, and Account ID of the Hub
  * Setup Vault:
    * Enables the AWS secrets engine
    * Persists the credentials that Vault will use to communicate with AWS
    * Configures a Vault role that maps to a set of permissions in AWS
  * Deploys the Cartography CronJob, scheduled to run every day at 7am

Verify pods are healthy:
```bash
‚ùØ kubectl -n cartography get po
NAME                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
neo4j-statefulset-0   2/2     Running   0          5h56m
```

üìù **NOTE FOR BAREMETAL**: before deploying, make sure to prepare
the data folder on the host (and to remove the same folder to reset the installation):
```bash
‚ùØ sudo mkdir -p /etc/plz-k8s-lab/cartography/neo4j/
‚ùØ sudo chmod -R a+rw /etc/plz-k8s-lab/cartography/
```


* Generates a random password for Neo4j and stores it into Vault
